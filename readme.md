# Matlab demo of Multilayer Perceptron
Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is a basic deep neural network model, usually for the purpose of classification.

I developed a Matlab demo of MLP, which can be a guide for beginners. 
This code will mainly tell you how to 
- pretrain by stacked sparse autoencoder, 
- finetune with back propagation algorithm, 
- predict using feedforward pass. 

## run

> run demo.m in Matlab

This demo take the MNIST handwritten digits recognition as an example (the setting in demo.m can obtain a classification accuracy around 98% on test set), and you can modify this code for other datasets.

## note
You'd better have a 4GB+ memory.
